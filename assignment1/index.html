      <h3> Personal Response</h3>
      <p>The author's perspective on the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the design industry raises thought-provoking questions about the future of design. The author expresses concern about AI eventually replacing traditional design practices/roles. However, I believe that incorporating AI into our design workflow/workspaces could be beneficial rather than the possible extinction of the role of human designers. I believe that human designers play a crucial role in ensuring users have an experience centered around human needs and preferences.</p>

     <p>The author points out the various complex roles of design as a translator, problem solver, and persuasive mechanism. Design is deeply ingrained in our culture and daily lives. I think the fear of AI replacing designers is understandable, given the technological advancements that allow AI to perform design tasks/roles faster and cheaper. However, AI completely taking over the design industry might be a bit of an exaggeration if anything. I think designers do more than just create visually appealing products. Designers bring creativity, empathy, and a human touch to their work, which I think are aspects that AI may struggle with or replicate.</p>
 
      <p>The discussion surrounding AI's continuing presence in user experience (UX) is an understandable and rational concern. AI&apos;s ability to analyze large datasets and predict user behavior has a massive amount of potential to enhance UX. However, the author's skepticism about designers becoming "prompt engineers" and the difficulty in preparing for the uncertain future of the design industry seems extremely pessimistic. Why not look on the bright side? I believe that designers can use AI to their advantage. AI might change the way we go about completing certain design tasks, but it could also open up new opportunities for designers to leverage their skills while using AI. Jacob Nielsen's statement "You won&apos;t lose your job to AI, but to someone who uses AI better than you do" emphasizes the importance of designers adapting to and mastering AI tools. It's important for designers to evolve alongside technology and that means incorporating AI into their workflow rather than resisting it.</p>
    
      <p>The theoretical scenario where AI replaces the entire process of user interaction, from internet searches to online shopping, paints a simple image of a future where AI dominates decision-making, design processes, and techniques. However, the author's perspective or opinion that design becomes irrelevant in a "hypothetical scenario" fails to consider the fact that the AI interface is a designed creation. I think the author's reflection on AI potentially dominating design resonates with many designers in the design industry. However, rather than viewing the use of AI as a threat, it can be seen as an opportunity for designers to adapt, evolve, and specialize in areas where human creativity, interaction, and insight are irreplaceable. The idea of "organic designers" who prioritize the human element in design may indeed become a reality while coexisting with AI but also catering to users or designers who value the uniqueness of human creativity.</p>
  
      <p>In conclusion, the author's concerns about the potential impact of AI on the design industry are valid. I think if we take a more optimistic perspective, AI can be a valuable tool that complements human creativity rather than replacing it. I believe designers have the opportunity to shape this integration/collaboration with AI while guaranteeing that the human aspect or element in design remains essential even if artificial intelligence dominates the world.</p>
