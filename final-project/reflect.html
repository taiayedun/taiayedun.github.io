Reflection
    </h3>
    <p>
        My journey through this web development class has been a rollercoaster ride of highs and lows, I think I faced a lot of challenges and triumphs. I think this class demanded a significant amount of time and effort outside of class that I wasn’t prepared for. I had a heavy course load this semester of 18 credits which resulted in me prioritizing my INMD 460: Teams class more because it demanded more. I found myself struggling to prioritize this class effectively which resulted in a constant battle to keep up with assignments and a nagging sense of falling behind. </p>

       <p> Looking back on the semester overall, I realize that one of my biggest hurdles was my reluctance to seek help when I needed it. Whether it was struggling to grasp concepts like JS and JQuery or even semantic HTML, I often found myself feeling lost and overwhelmed. I often looked a lot of concepts up instead of reaching out to my peers or the instructor for assistance, I chose to soldier on alone, hoping that things would eventually fall into place however they didn’t somewhat. I think as the weeks went by, I found myself feeling frustrated and having self-doubt, wondering why I couldn’t grasp these concepts more quickly. Why did it feel like everyone else was sailing through the material while I was barely managing? It was a humbling experience, one that forced me to confront my limitations, but I think I also gained moments of clarity and growth amidst the struggles. However, I did enjoy the following assignments: CCS animations, Creative Exploration, Style Guide, and Wireframes. I think they allowed my creativity to shine the most. I gained a deeper understanding of the importance of time management and prioritization. However, I realize that I could have avoided much of the stress and anxiety by allocating my time more wisely and setting clear, achievable goals for myself. It's a lesson that I will carry with me long after this class is over. Looking back on the Final Project, I wish I started earlier and focused more on the practical/reasonable thing I knew how to do. I think I had so many ideas that I couldn’t zero in on one working concept. </p>
       
      <p> I think this class has equipped me with a valuable set of skills and knowledge that I can carry forward into the future as an aspiring UI/UX designer, it is important to have basic knowledge of other disciplines/ career fields. In the end, my journey through the web development class has been challenging but also eye opening. It has pushed me out of my comfort zone, forced me to confront my own shortcomings, and ultimately challenged my ability to code.
